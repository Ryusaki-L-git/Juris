"""
core/permissions.py — JURIS Permission Engine.

The permission layer is the enforcement boundary between the JURIS agent
and LED data.  This is one of the most critical architectural components.

DESIGN PRINCIPLE:
    The LLM does not decide what it is allowed to access.
    The model may *request* a tool call; JURIS decides whether to execute it.

    Request flow:
        Model requests tool
            ↓
        Orchestrator calls PermissionEngine.check(...)
            ↓
        PermissionEngine evaluates identity + resource
            ↓
        ALLOWED  → tool executes, result returned to model
        DENIED   → PermissionDenied raised, model receives denial notice

    The model never sees raw permission logic.
    The model never receives data it was not authorized to receive.

For Phase 2, this module defines the contracts and raises
NotImplementedError stubs.  Real evaluation logic (against Firestore
rules / LED team records) is introduced in Phase 3 / 4.

DO NOT add fake "always allow" logic here.
