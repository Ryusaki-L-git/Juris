"""
core/identity.py — JURIS request identity.

Defines who is making a request to JURIS.

This is the *architecture contract*, not a production auth implementation.
Authentication (JWT verification, Firebase token validation) is Phase 3.

Key design rule:
    Identity is resolved BEFORE any permission check or tool execution.
    The identity object is immutable once created.
    Nothing downstream can elevate its own privileges.
