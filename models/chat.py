"""
models/chat.py — LED ↔ JURIS API contract for the /chat endpoint.

ChatRequest  — what LED Flutter sends to JURIS.
ChatResponse — what JURIS returns to LED Flutter.

Design rules:
  - All fields are typed and documented.
  - No AI provider types leak into this contract.
  - LED must not need to change when JURIS switches model providers.
  - The contract is stable; internals change behind it.
