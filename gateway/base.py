"""
gateway/base.py — JURIS Model Gateway abstraction.

This is the architectural boundary between JURIS and any AI model provider.

DESIGN PRINCIPLE:
    The rest of JURIS (orchestrator, tools, API) must never import
    a provider-specific SDK or type directly.  All model interaction
    happens through this interface.

    Swapping providers = implementing a new subclass + updating config.
    Zero changes to orchestrator, tools, or API routes.

SECURITY PRINCIPLE:
    The model never receives raw user data, Firestore documents, or
    eCourts records.  It receives only what the orchestrator explicitly
    constructs and passes via ModelRequest.tool_results.

    The model may *request* a tool call.  The orchestrator validates
    and executes it.  The model does not execute tools directly.
