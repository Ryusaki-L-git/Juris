"""
gateway/echo_gateway.py — JURIS development gateway.

This is the ONLY gateway active during Phase 2.

Purpose:
    Fulfil the JurisModelGateway interface without calling any external
    model, making any network request, or returning fake AI responses.

    The echo gateway makes the pipeline structurally complete — every
    code path from LED → API → orchestrator → gateway → response works
    and is testable — without requiring an AI model or API key.

What it does NOT do:
    - It does NOT simulate AI behaviour.
    - It does NOT return legal analysis.
    - It does NOT pretend to be an LLM.
    - It does NOT make network calls.

When to replace it:
    When a real model is ready, implement a new JurisModelGateway subclass
    (e.g. GeminiGateway) and update the factory in gateway/factory.py.
    The rest of the codebase changes nothing.
